# One Word Bot

One Word Bot is a fun and interactive Discord bot that lets you and your friends write a story together â€” **one word at a time**. Collaborate, compete, and watch as your random words turn into hilarious, wild, or epic stories!

---

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

1. **Start a game** with your friends.
2. **Take turns** adding one word each (unless itâ€™s a name or place).
3. Try to build a story together, one word at a time.
4. The person who starts the game is called the **Host**.

> **Note:**  
> - Please use double quotes `"` for open and end quotes, instead of single quotes `'`.  
> - Incorrect grammar may cause the story not to appear correctly in the `-view` command, since spaces are inserted based on grammar rules.
> - Only the **Host** (or Admin, for ending the game) has access to some moderation commands.
